# Project: Data Analysis of Conflict-Related Demonstrations (October 2023 – October 2024)

### **Objective**
This project aims to analyze global protests triggered by the Middle Eastern crisis that began with the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel and Israel’s subsequent military responses. The analysis spans from October 2023 to October 2024, focusing on geographic trends, protest motivations, temporal patterns, and government responses. By leveraging an interactive map and related datasets, the project provides insights into the dynamics of these conflict-related demonstrations across regions such as the Middle East, North Africa, Western Europe, and the United States.

### **Key Problem Statement**
The 7 October 2023 Hamas attack and Israel’s ensuing military operations led to a surge in global demonstrations, particularly in regions closely tied to the conflict. Following a decline in activity in mid-2024, demonstrations resurged in October, coinciding with the conflict’s anniversary and Israel’s increased military actions in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. This project seeks to explore and visualize:
- Regional and temporal trends in protest activity.
- Variations in protest motivations (e.g., pro-Palestine, pro-Israel, ceasefire advocacy).
- The relationship between protest size, outcomes, and government responses.

### **Insights from the Analysis**

#### **1. Geographic Trends**
- **Regional Concentration**: The majority of protests occurred in the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the immediate impact of the crisis. Western Europe and the United States also experienced significant protest activity due to public awareness and diaspora involvement.
- **Global Distribution**: Events spanned multiple continents, with urban centers in Western Europe and North America hosting larger gatherings.

#### **2. Protest Motivations**
- **Support for Palestine**: A significant portion of protests were driven by solidarity with Palestinian communities.
- **Advocacy for Ceasefires**: Many protests called for peace negotiations, reflecting a humanitarian focus.
- **Support for Israel**: While fewer in number, these protests were concentrated in regions with prominent Israeli diaspora communities.

#### **3. Temporal Patterns**
- **Anniversary Peaks**: Demonstrations peaked around the first anniversary of the conflict, highlighting the role of significant dates in protest mobilization.
- **Event-Driven Spikes**: Escalations, such as Israel’s ground offensive into southern Lebanon, triggered noticeable increases in protest activity.

#### **4. Protest Sizes**
- **Variation**: Protests ranged from small gatherings to large demonstrations involving thousands.
- **Urban Dominance**: Larger demonstrations were more common in metropolitan areas of Western Europe and North America.

#### **5. Government Responses**
- **Violent Reactions**: Protests in the Middle East often faced violent suppression, reflecting heightened tensions.
- **Peaceful Engagement**: Protests in Western democracies tended to be more peaceful, though some incidents of police intervention were recorded.

#### **6. Outcomes**
- **Policy Influence**: Prolonged protests (lasting more than three months) correlated with notable outcomes, including increased humanitarian aid and policy changes.

#### **7. Visualizations**
- **Bar Charts**: Highlighted regional dominance of Middle Eastern countries in protest activities.
- **Pie Charts**: Illustrated motivations, with a significant portion advocating for Palestinian solidarity and ceasefire.
- **Heatmaps**: Showed correlations between protest size and achieved outcomes.

### **Conclusion**
This project highlights the widespread impact of the Middle Eastern crisis on global demonstrations. By analyzing geographic, temporal, and motivational aspects, the study underscores the role of public opinion and activism in shaping responses to humanitarian and political crises. The findings emphasize the importance of collective action and the varying dynamics of protests across different political and cultural contexts.
